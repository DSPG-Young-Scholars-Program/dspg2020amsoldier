      <description>2020 NEH American Soldier Summer Project The objective of this project is to use a novel data source to garner new insights into race, gender, and spacial relationships between army soldiers during world war II. The project uses transcribed data from a crowdsourcing platform to create textual data. The survey that we are focusing on is Survey 32 which is a survey that includes one multiple choice question on whether or not soldiers want separated or integrated outfits and two response questions giving space for them to extend on their multiple choice answer and their sentiments on the survey as a whole.</description>

      <description>UVA Data Science for the Public Good Program The Data Science for the Public Good (DSPG) Young Scholars program is a summer immersive program held at the Biocomplexity Instituteâ€™s Social and Decision Analytics division (SDAD). In its seventh year, the program engages students from across the country to work together on projects that address state, federal, and local government challenges around critical social issues relevant in the world today. DSPG young scholars conduct research at the intersection of statistics, computation, and the social sciences to determine how information generated within every community can be leveraged to improve quality of life and inform public policy.</description>
