<h2>Topic Model Networks</h2>
<p>A topic model put simply models the topics in a piece of text and the words that are associated with each topic. Naturally, words may fall in multiple topics and the model accounts for this by giving each topic a probability distribution over the words. A Topic Model Network is a useful way to visualize the topics and the words associated with each topic. Here we will explore two different topic models.</p>
<div id="latent-dirichlet-allocation" class="section level3">
<h3>Latent Dirichlet Allocation</h3>
<p>Latent Dirchlet Allocation, or LDA, is the typical go to method for topic modelling. We chose to model the texts with 6 topics. We can see that in the three networks this produces very disconnected topics which intuitively seems to be a poor fit as the corpus is rather small and the soldiers are responding to direct and specific questions. LDA does produce a better connected network for the white soldiers outfits comment but does not do a great job in delineating the topics.</p>

<h3>BTM</h3>
<p>There are some drawbacks to using LDA for our dataset, namely it doesn't handle short texts well. That is why we also implemented a <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BTM/index.html">Biterm Topic Model</a> that does better on short texts. Overall, it seems that the topic model networks produced this way strike a better balance between effectively delineating the topics and showing interconnectivity.</p>
