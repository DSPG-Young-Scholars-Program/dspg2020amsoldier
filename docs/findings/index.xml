      <description>While this page is optional, it probably makes sense to have one weighted at the top (see the front matter at the top of this Rmd file) that gives a general overview of the project. This could be something like the final poster while the other pages highlight more in-depth observations. Here is a general schema of what should be covered throughout your website:

      <description>[Here you will describe the data discoversy process, the data used, and the methods employed for this single page.

      <description>Who Are the Soldiers? Survey 32 was given out to soldiers in 1943, approximately 5 years before the military was integrated. The survey was passed out to 7442 black soldiers and 4793 white soldiers and asked for basic demographic information, career aspirations, and more but of interests to us, Survey 32 asked the soldiers for their opinions on integration of military outfits. Our questions of interest are regarding age, education, enlistment, state, community type, and of course their opinions on outfits.</description>

      <description>Who Are the Soldiers? Survey 144 was given out to soldiers in 1944, approximately 4 years before the military was integrated. The survey was passed out to 4678 black soldiers and focused on post-war aspirations and plans of the soldiers. Of particular interest to us however, is the soldiers&#39; responses to question if their lives would be better after the war.
