### 2020 NEH American Soldier Summer Project {style=text-align:center}

The objective of this project is to use a novel data source to garner new insights into race, gender, and spacial relationships between army soldiers during world war II. The project uses transcribed data from a crowdsourcing platform to create textual data. The survey that we are focusing on is Survey 32 which is a survey that includes one multiple choice question on whether or not soldiers want separated or integrated outfits and two response questions giving space for them to extend on their multiple choice answer and their sentiments on the survey as a whole. This data is divided by race, and we only have text data on the multiple choice answer for white soldiers.  

In addition to Survey 32 we also have data from Survey 144 and Survey 195 which include more educated black soldiers and multiple choice answers on women in the army corps, respectively. From these three surveys we are extracting insights into race relations, gender relations, and the relationship between race and spatial arrangement. We are creating a website that outlines the exploratory data analysis, sentiments, text networks, and topics included in soldier's responses for these three broad topics. 

### Project Goals {style=text-align:center}

This project is devoted to giving the public insight into survey data taken in 1943 during WWII. Specifically we are interested in exploring:
* Race Relations
* Gender Relations
* The role of race in different spaces

### Our Approach {style=text-align:center}

We are employing methods from text analysis and sentiment analysis to understand the texts. In addition, we use topic modeling to get a sense of what the soldiers are talking about in general. We also use social netowrk analysis to explore relationships in the text.
