<p>An aspect of racial segregation that we want to analyze is segregation related to spatial arrangement. Spatial segregation of Black Americans was enforced in the American South with numerous local and state laws known as the Jim Crow laws from late 19th century to early 20th century. [include more context].</p>
<p>We are interested to see if themes of spatial segregation are prevelant in the soldiers' responses and experiences in the army during WWII.</p>

<h3>Black versus White Long Question</h3>
<p><img src="/findings/spatial_arrangement_overview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>When Black soldiers are talking about spatial arrangements, we see that there's a greater amount of commentary from black soldiers than white soldiers (below).</p>
<p>Seating arrangements pop up in conversation with bigrams of &quot;set seat&quot;, &quot;front seat&quot; as well as &quot;cafe sit&quot;.</p>
<p>Furthermore, spatial arrangements in which the Black soldiers talk about in regards to integration include camp, living, eating, px, service club, barrack and theater. All of these words are paired with words such as &quot;mix&quot;, &quot;together&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, &quot;separate&quot;, and &quot;individual.&quot;</p>
<p><img src="/findings/spatial_arrangement_overview_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="1152" /></p>
<p>The white soldiers also have commentary on the integration in regards to spatial arrangement in the army. We see that they want separate messhalls, and to not eat or live with the Black soldiers. However, we also see words such as &quot;with&quot;, &quot;same&quot; and &quot;together&quot;. Perhaps some white soldiers were okay with integration, but without context we cannot tell if those bigrams are also associated with some negations.</p>

<p>There are very few bigrams due to a relatively small dictionary and low volume of responses (under 100). However, we can see that the soldiers wanted different messhalls, barracks and separate px's despite wanting to integrate outfits. There is also commentary on sharing the same barracks, but due to the nature of bigrams, there is a possibility there was negative commentary on this pair of words.</p>

<p>Although there were white soldiers who supported integration of army outfits, there was still clear commentary that the soldiers should not be sharing the space in living arrangements or social spaces. An interesting observation is that persons of other ethnicities are associated with living.</p>
