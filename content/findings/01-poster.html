<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The American Soldier project is a digital history project funded by the National Endowment of Humanities and is led by Ed Gitre of Virginia Tech. The goal of the overall project is to take a range of surveys and commentaries by WW2 soldiers and a wide range of topics from race and gender relations, career plans, thoughts on South East Asia, and much more. Along with Ed, we have Mark Embree of Virginia Tech leading an effort in using Machine Learning to unpack and understand all the text data generated by the soldiers. Our teamâ€™s contribution to the project is to understand race relations, gender relations, and the interaction between race and space via a collection of surveys touching upon these issues as well as commentaries by the soldiers which were transcribed by citizen scientists on the Zooniverse platform.</p>
<p>To approach these topics, we specifically looked at Survey 32, 144, and 190 which contain multiple choice questions ranging from demographic information, race and gender relations, thoughts on the army, war, and career plans.</p>
<p>Survey 32 was administered to both black and white soldiers in order to studying attitudes of and towards black soldiers. A question of interest on the survey is, &quot;Do you think white and black soldiers should be in separate outfits?&quot; The soldiers gave a response to this as a multiple choice question and we have 7442 responses from black soldiers and 4678 from white soldeiors. The soldiers also had room to elaborate on their responses in a short answer field. Along with this short response, there was room for a longer comment on the overall survey. Unfortunately, we do not have any short responses to the question from black soldiers. Overall, we have 3464 written responses from black soldiers and 2324 written responses of white soldiers. The responeses themselves were on the shorter side with the average response length being shorter than 100 words.</p>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Our analysis was completed using three different tools: sentiment analysis, text networks, and topic modeling. These three tools help us glean insights into the feelings of soldiers, the frequencies of terms they used, and which overall topics they discussed. The text analysis is completed on Survey 32 text data and separates soldiers into four main groups of text: black soldiers' long responses, white soldiers' long responses, pro-segregation white soldier's short responses, and anti-segregation white soldier's short responses. Black and white soldiers' long responses are compared and pro- and anti-segregation white soldiers' short responses are compared.</p>
<p>For the sentiment analysis, we used a slightly modified version of the <a href="https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm">NRC dictionary</a> which is a library of over 14,000 words and their associated values with eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments (negative and positive).</p>

<h3>Spatial Arrangement</h3>
<p>An aspect of racial segregation that we want to analyze is segregation related to spatial arrangement. Spatial segregation of Black Americans was enforced in the American South with numerous local and state laws known as the Jim Crow laws from late 19th century to early 20th century.</p>
<p>We are interested to see if themes of spatial segregation are prevelant in the soldiers' responses and experiences in the army during WWII.</p>
<p>When Black soldiers are talking about spatial arrangements, we see that there's a greater amount of commentary from black soldiers than white soldiers. Seating arrangements pop up in conversation with bigrams of &quot;set seat&quot;, &quot;front seat&quot; as well as &quot;cafe sit&quot;. Furthermore, spatial arrangements in which the Black soldiers talk about in regards to integration include camp, living, eating, px, service club, barrack and theater. All of these words are paired with words such as &quot;mix&quot;, &quot;together&quot;, &quot;same&quot;, &quot;separate&quot;, and &quot;individual.&quot;</p>
<p>The white soldiers also have commentary on the integration in regards to spatial arrangement in the army. We see that they want separate messhalls, and to not eat or live with the Black soldiers. However, we also see words such as &quot;with&quot;, &quot;same&quot; and &quot;together&quot;. Perhaps some white soldiers were okay with integration, but without context we cannot tell if those bigrams are also associated with some negations.</p>

<p>Although there were white soldiers who supported integration of army outfits, there was still clear commentary that the soldiers should not be sharing the space in living arrangements or social spaces. An interesting observation is that persons of other ethnicities are associated with living.</p>
